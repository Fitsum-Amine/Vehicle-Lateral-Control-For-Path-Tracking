# Vehicle-Lateral-Control-For-Path-Tracking
This Seminaar project is about the lateral control of path-following for autonomous vehicles. It tests three path-following strategies for both low- and high-speed maneuvering. It is implemented and compared in terms of performance using the Vehicle Body 3DOF Dual Track model from the Vehicle Dynamics Blockset in MATLAB.
